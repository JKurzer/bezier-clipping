# intersection algorithm for two Bezier curves

find intersection points between two Bezier curves using Bezier clipping

m = n + p + 1 should be satisfied for a curve
(m: knot vector, n: control point, p: degree of the curve)

limitation: not for overlapping curves, self intersection

print verbose debug information: command > output.txt may be preferred
